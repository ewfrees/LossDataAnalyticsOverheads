## Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Goal
The goal is to have the actuarial community author our textbooks in a collaborative fashion. *GitHub* provides a natural development environment to achieve this goal. See the [Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Site](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/loss-data-analytics/) for more information about this project.

### Loss Data Analytics
Most of the work has been done on modeling **Loss Data**. See our [GitHub Site](https://github.com/ewfrees/Loss-Data-Analytics ) for more information about these efforts. 

To see our progress, a draft of a few chapters of the book is available at 
* [Online Version from R Bookdown](http://instruction.bus.wisc.edu/jfrees/UWCAELearn/LossDataAnalytics/index.html) 
* [R Bookdown - pdf version](http://instruction.bus.wisc.edu/jfrees/UWCAELearn/LossDataAnalytics/LossDataAnalytics.pdf)
* [R Bookdown - EPUB version](http://instruction.bus.wisc.edu/jfrees/UWCAELearn/LossDataAnalytics/LossDataAnalytics.epub)


## Overheads for Loss Data Analtyics

This site provides overheads for the drafts of our **Loss Data Analytics** chapters. Overheads, suitable for demonstrating to a class, are in the **Overheads_pdf** folder. The **LatexSourceCode** folder provides latex files (using the presentation package **Beamer**) as well as input graphs should you wish to modify these files for your own purposes.

## Your Help
As described in our [License](https://github.com/ewfrees/Loss-Data-Analytics/tree/master/GettingStarted/LICENSE.md), anyone can use these files. Especially at this early stage of the project, if you want to help and would like more info, please write Jed Frees <jfrees@bus.wisc.edu>.
